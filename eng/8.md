### Task 1

The pie chart illustrates the primary causes of declining productivity worldwide, while the accompanying table compares how these factors contributed to land becoming less productive in North America, Europe, Oceania respectively in the 1990s.

According to the pie chart, over-grazing accounts for 35% of global land degradation, followed by deforestation at 30%. Over-cultivation represents 28%, leaving only 7% for other causes.

In terms of regional breakdown, Europe shows a total of 23% of its area being affected. Deforestation(9.8%) and Over-cultivation(7.7%) was particularly severe in this region. By contrast, North America's total degraded land is just 5%, with over-cultivation being the main issue, and deforestation at mere 0.2%. Oceania, on the other hand, records a total of 13% of land degradation, driven largely by over-grazing (11.3%), while no land was degraded by over-cultivation in this region.

### Task

> Some people think that parents should teach children how to be good members of society. Others, however, believe that school is the place to learn this. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.

In the modern world, the responsibility for teaching children to become socially conscientious individuals has `sparked considerable debate`. While some people argue that this duty primarily lies with parents, others `contend` that schools are best positioned to impart these values. In my opinion, although parents play an `indispensable必不可少的` role in shaping a child’s `moral 礼仪compass`, schools also hold significant responsibility in this process.

Parents are typically a child’s first and most influential role models. From a very young age, children observe their parents’ behavior and often `imitate` it. `Consequently`, parents can `instill` core values such as honesty, respect, and empathy through their daily interactions. Moreover, the family environment allows for personalized and consistent guidance, as parents can `tailor` their approach to each child’s unique personality and needs. By demonstrating positive conduct and setting clear boundaries, parents create a supportive atmosphere that nurtures moral development.

On the other hand, schools provide a structured environment in which children learn to cooperate, communicate, and resolve conflicts with peers from diverse backgrounds. Teachers and educational curricula can reinforce moral and social lessons by offering real-world scenarios, group projects, and extracurricular activities. For instance, collaborative tasks in class can teach students about teamwork and respect for differing opinions, while volunteering initiatives promote compassion and civic responsibility. In this way, schools complement the moral lessons taught at home by extending them to a broader social context.

In conclusion, both parents and schools play crucial roles in teaching children how to be good members of society. While parents `lay the foundational values` through direct role modeling and personalized guidance, schools `reinforce` and expand these lessons by `fostering` social interactions and civic engagement. Ultimately, a balanced partnership between families and educational institutions `is essential to` shaping responsible and ethical future citizens.

> The pie charts illustrates the total school spending in a particular school in 1981, 1991 and 2001 respectively.

The pie charts illustrate the changes in the annual expenditure of a particular UK school in 1981, 1991, and 2001.

> According to the pie charts, teachers's salaries are the accounts for the biggest part of total spending at around 45% percent while insurance represents the least(<10%) throughout the years.

`It is evident that` teachers’ salaries `consistently accounted for` the largest `portion` of the budget across all three years, while insurance remained the smallest expense. Over the years, `notable shifts occurred` in the `allocation of funds` for other workers’ salaries, resources, and furniture.

> From 1981 to 2001, Other worker's salaries showes a decreasing trend. By contrast, the spending in insurance slowly increases decade by decade. The spending in resources and furniture and equipment shows an opposite trend. From 1981 to 1991, spending in resources increased from 15% to 20% while furniture dropped from 15% to only 5%, and from 1991 to 2001, The spending in resources decreased dramatically from 20% to 9% while furniture rocketed by 18%.

From 1981 to 1991, the `proportion allocated` to teachers' salaries rose from 40% to 50%, `peaking` at its highest level in 1991 before slightly decreasing to 45% in 2001. `Conversely`, the budget for other workers' salaries decreased `steadily` from 28% in 1981 to 22% in 1991 and `further down` to 15% by 2001.

Expenditure on resources (such as books) `showed fluctuations`. It increased from 15% in 1981 to 20% in 1991 but then `dropped sharply` to just 9% in 2001. Meanwhile, the spending on furniture and equipment `exhibited the opposite pattern`, declining significantly from 15% to 5% between 1981 and 1991, before `rising sharply` to 23% in 2001.

Finally, insurance costs, though `consistently the smallest proportion` of the budget, showed a gradual increase over the years, rising from 2% in 1981 to 3% in 1991 and reaching 8% in 2001.

Overall, the data suggests that while teachers' salaries remained the primary expense, `major fluctuations` occurred in spending on resources and furniture, and insurance gradually became a more significant expense.

Technology has undoubtedly `transformed` the ways in which people form and maintain relationships. From instant messaging and video calls to social media platforms, our interactions are increasingly mediated by digital tools. This essay will `examine` how technology has `reshaped` the types of connections people make and discuss whether this shift is largely `beneficial or detrimental`.

One significant impact of technology is the `sheer ease with which` new relationships can be established. Online communities allow individuals with niche interests to find each other across vast distances, expanding social circles far beyond traditional geographic limitations. For instance, gamers or hobbyists can join international forums and make friends in different countries, an opportunity that would have been `virtually` impossible a few decades ago. Moreover, family members separated by work or education can maintain close bonds through video conferencing, reducing the emotional strain of long-distance relationships.

However, technology has also influenced the nature and depth of these connections. While digital platforms `facilitate`促进 swift communication, they can sometimes lead to more `superficial浅` or `transient短暂的，瞬态的` relationships. The immediacy of social media posts and the pressure to maintain an online image may result in interactions that lack genuine intimacy. In extreme cases, people may prioritize virtual validation—such as “likes” or comments—over meaningful, face-to-face contact. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that many individuals successfully balance online and offline interactions, using technology as a `supplement 补充rather than a substitute替代` for real-world engagement.

On balance, I would argue that the changes brought about by technology are `predominantly主要` positive. The potential for global networking, cross-cultural exchange, and staying connected with distant loved ones outweighs the drawbacks of occasionally shallow online interactions. `Ultimately`, technology serves as a powerful tool that, if used wisely, can strengthen personal and professional relationships rather than weaken them.

Recently, the question about separat schools and mixed schools has sparked considerable debate. While some people argue that it is better to educate boys and girls in seperate schools, others contend that boys and grils benefit more from attending mixed schools. In my opinion, although sperate schools has some remarkable advantages, mixed schools are still superior than separated schools in many ways.

One significant impact of seperated school is that it can reduce distractions and foster better concentration on school work thus lead to better academic scores. For instance,

People have `differing opinions regarding whether` boys and girls should be educated separately or together in mixed-gender schools. While single-sex education can offer certain academic benefits, I `firmly` believe that coeducational schooling `provides` students with richer social experiences and `better prepares` them for real-life interactions.

`Advocates` of single-sex education argue that boys and girls have distinct learning styles, and separating them allows `tailored量身定做的` teaching methods that can significantly enhance academic performance. For example, some studies suggest boys are often more active learners who `thrive in茁壮成长于` competitive and physically engaging environments, while girls might prefer cooperative and discussion-based learning activities. Single-sex schools can customize their curricula and teaching styles accordingly, `thereby` potentially improving students' academic outcomes. Moreover, it is argued that separating genders can reduce distractions related to adolescent relationships, enabling students to concentrate more fully on their studies.

On the other hand, `proponents 支持者of` mixed education `emphasize its social advantages`. Mixed schools reflect the real world, where genders naturally interact. By learning alongside the opposite sex, students develop crucial interpersonal skills such as cooperation, effective communication, and empathy. From my personal experience, attending a mixed-gender school significantly improved my confidence in communicating and collaborating with individuals of the opposite gender. Such early socialization prepares students for university life and professional environments, where interactions between men and women are commonplace and essential.

Furthermore, mixed-gender schools promote gender equality by providing both sexes equal access to resources, opportunities, and encouragement in a shared environment. Students educated in mixed schools may develop more balanced perspectives about gender roles and are less likely to hold stereotypical views. This inclusive environment helps build mutual respect and understanding between genders from an early age.

In conclusion, although single-sex education might have certain academic advantages, the social and developmental benefits of mixed schooling are far greater. Mixed-gender education offers comprehensive preparation for future personal and professional interactions, fostering 促进greater equality and mutual understanding among students.
