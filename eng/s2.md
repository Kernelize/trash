I'd like to talk about a traditional Chinese product, which is Chinese silk.

Recently, my mother bought some silk clothes online. It was green and beautiful and there are some traditional patterns such as flowers and birds on it.

Chinese silk is made from natural silk fibers produced by silkworms. The production of silk is a delicate process, involving careful harvesting, spinning, weaving, and dyeing. This process makes silk extremely soft, shiny, and comfortable to wear, especially during warm weather.

I feel very proud of Chinese silk because it has a long history and is an important part of Chinese culture. Silk is special because it shows beauty and skill from the past. When my mom wore her silk dress, I felt happy and connected to our traditions. It showed me how traditional products can still be part of our everyday lives today.


1. Where should children learn about culture, at school or at home?
   I think children should learn about culture both at home and at school.

Pride in one's culture promotes self-confidence and respect, helps preserve valuable traditions, and fosters understanding and respect among people from diverse backgrounds.

3. Why is it important for children to learn about traditional products?
   It's important because traditional products often comes with history, creativity, and cultural heritage.
