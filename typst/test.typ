In this report, *we will* explore the
various factors that influence _fluid
dynamics_ in glaciers and how they
contribute to the formation and
behaviour of these natural structures.

= Background

Glaciers as the one shown in
@glaciers will cease to exist if
we don't take action soon!

= Maths
The equation $Q = rho A v + C$
defines the glacial flow rate.

The flow rate of a glacier is
defined by the following equation:
$ Q = rho A v + C $

Total displaced soil by glacial flow:
$ 7.32 beta +
  sum_(i=0)^nabla Q_i / 2 $
$ v := vec(x_1, x_2, x_3) $
$ a arrow.squiggly b $
